# Using Python for "big data" Analysis

For this project, I used two large datasets to showcase the limits of Excel-based analysis (Crowdfunding and Stock Market Projects). As a Data Analyst, I want to provide robust options for handling datasets, particularly "big datasets". Therefore, for this project, I created two robust Python scripts in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), instead of an Excel-based analysis. VSCode was selected as the source code editor because of its reliability and powerful developer tooling. VSCode is today's most popular development environment.

Each script runs separately to make sure the code works for its respective dataset: Financial data and Voting data. The two datasets are uniquely different. One dataset if from a bank and the other is voting data from a rural town. Each dataset requires a thoughtful break down of tasks into discrete mini-objectives to render the printing of the analysis to the terminal for immediate visual results and exporting a text file of the results for documentation purposes.
