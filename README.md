# Using Python for "big data" Analysis

For this project, I used two large datasets to showcase the limits of Excel-based analysis (Crowdfunding and Stock Market Projects). As a Data Analyst, I want to provide robust options for handling datasets, particularly "big datasets". Therefore, for this project, I created two robust Python scripts in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), instead of an Excel-based analysis. VSCode was selected as the source code editor because of its reliability and powerful developer tooling. VSCode is today's most popular development environment.
